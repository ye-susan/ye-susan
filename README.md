### Hi there! </ðŸ¤“>
#### I'm a full-stack developer currently volunteering at Hack for LA (where I write documentation and assist with adding new features to our site). 
I'm always looking to learn about new (tech/productivity hacks/relaxing shows/hikes/books/cultures) and looking forward to meeting fellow engineers - connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-ye-dev/)!ðŸ‘¯ 
Feel free to reach out to me if you're also interested in getting involved in Hack for LA/civic tech.
